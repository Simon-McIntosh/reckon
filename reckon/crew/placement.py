"""One reservation held once, and the workers that run inside it as steps.

A job per worker mints a reservation per worker, so concurrency would mean
submitting more reservations rather than sizing one, and nothing would be
shared between the sessions on this host. The design here is the opposite: a
single reservation is held once through an ensure command, its job id is
published into the shared crew state, and every session places its workers into
that one allocation as steps.

Steps are asked with ``--overlap``, and the reason is what a worker is. A
worker spends nearly all its life blocked on the served model, so reserving
cores exactly for one prices an idle process; ``--exact`` would turn the
allocation into a quota a worker queues behind, while ``--overlap`` makes it a
place to run. Because nothing is then enforced, the concurrency limit is ours
to hold, and it is held in the roster: a cap sized from resident memory per
worker against the reservation's own reserved memory, because memory is the
axis that binds and cores are the cheap one.
